## Intro

Welcome to the webpage of supplementary material of our Siggraph 2018 project titled: **Perception Aware Modeling and Fabrication of Digital Drawing Tools**. On this pages you will find our collected friction and vibration measurements of drawing tools, as well as, a detailed assembly guide of our measurement setup. You can find more information and the full paper on our [project webpage](http://pdf.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/DigitalStylus/).
